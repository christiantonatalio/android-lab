# Christianto's Android Lab
This repository is where I play around with various Android projects

The default branch is master, a clean slate I use to start new projects.
Each project has its own branch, like jetpack-compose-learning/notes-app, jetpack-compose-learning/weather-app, etc. (I've been learning a lot about jetpack compose lately😁)
